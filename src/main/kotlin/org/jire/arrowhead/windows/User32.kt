	 *
	 * @param nVirtKey A virtual key. If the desired virtual key is a letter or digit
	 * (_A_ through _Z_, _a_ through _z_, or _0_ through _9_), `nVirtKey` must be set to the ASCII value
	 * of that character. For other keys, it must be a virtual-key code.
	 *
	 * If a non-English keyboard layout is used, virtual keys with values in the range ASCII
	 * _A_ through _Z_ and _0_ through _9_ are used to specify most of the character keys. For example,
	 * for the German keyboard layout, the virtual key of value ASCII _O_ (_0x4F_) refers to the "o" key,
	 * whereas _VK_OEM_1_ refers to the "o with umlaut" key.
