####_What?! What about CheatLife?_
We are striving to make CheatLife the absolute best CS:GO cheat ever created.. and this means that our engineering
is state of the art, and eclipses perfection. But perfection takes a long time to achieve. In the mean time, I'd like
to get out a new, undetected cheat which is a major step up from [Abendigo](https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo)-- and this is what _Charlatano_ is.

####_What's missing from Charlatano compared to CheatLife?_

Besides the systems not being as good (although they are, again, still a major step up from Charlatano's)..
Charlatano does not have kernel-mode execution (obcallbacks bypass), does not have Mac or Linux support,
does not have artificial intelligence aim paths, does not have screenshot prevention (ESEA/CEVO),
and does not bypass ESEA.

####_But what does it have over Charlatano?_
Stream-safe OpenGL ESP, all aim flicking / invalid angles fixed, next to zero FPS loss from far better performance,
SMAC aimbot/bhop/trigger bypass, humanized aim paths, and writing to game memory can be disabled entirely.
It also will be released with out-of-the-box obfuscation (which will be one build, shared by all "free" users),
and a premium service which will give you a unique build & full customer support from myself and other devs.
