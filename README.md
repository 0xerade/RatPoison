**From the creators of Abendigo** comes a brand new approach to cheating-- _Charlatano_ can be completely
__stream-proof__, hiding the fact that you're cheating while streaming, and completely bypasses SMAC server-sided
anticheat as well as FaceIT's modified SMAC. Turning off visuals or using a screenshot blocker
(like hypervisor-powered protection against screenshots in Kaspersky) can potentially allow you to play on leagues
like ESEA for weeks or months. _Charlatano_ uses strong humanizing settings that bring the public the next step in
free and open-source cheating software!

**Available Features**
* Always-on all-weapon smooth recoil control system
* Aim bot with humanized aim paths
* Low-FOV "perfect aim" (non-silent)
* Aim assistance mode for professional and high-level players
* FOV bone trigger bot
* Reduced flash
* Stream-proof OpenGL overlay with box and skeleton ESP
* Glow ESP (not stream-proof)
* Humanized bunny hop using scroll input[/list]
